# irl_training

## Description

This directory is used to store my IRL/reward learning implementations, which I adapted from examples provided by the `imitation` library. It contains six algorithms (listed below) and an abstract template class for providing a standard interface to my implementations.

- AIRL - `airl.py`
- Behaviour Cloning - `bcloning.py`
- DAgger (Dataset Aggregation) - `DAgger.py`
- (Kernel) Density-based Reward Modelling - `density_based_reward_modelling.py`
- GAIL - `gail.py`
- Preference Comparisons - `pref_comp.py`
- Abstract, Template class - `irl_template.py`
