    """ 
        Extension of the FullObsDoubleKAZ environment, which is used to train a SINGLE RL policy for controlling both the knight and archer agents.
        In order to do this, the RL agent is given a full game observation from the perspective of the archer - arbritary choice, but makes sense since the purpose
        of this work is to research the Assistant agent's behaviour. Furthermore, the rewards from both the knight and archer agents are returned together 
        with the hope that the RL policy learns to maximise their collective total reward. Both agents take the same action.
